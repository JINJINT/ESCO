\description{
Estimate the midpoint and shape parameters for the logistic function used
when simulating dropout.

Estimate the midpoint and shape parameters for the logistic function used
when simulating dropout.
}
\details{
Logistic function parameters are estimated by fitting a logistic function
to the relationship between log2 mean gene expression and the proportion of
zeros in each gene. See \code{\link[stats]{nls}} for details of fitting.
Note this is done on the experiment level, more granular (eg. group or cell)
level dropout is not estimated.
