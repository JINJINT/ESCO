\title{Simulate observed count matrix though downsampling.
(This function is borrowed from SymSim).}
\usage{
escoSimDownSample(sim, trial, verbose, numCores = 2, protocol = "UMI",
  nbatch = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim}{SingleCellExperiment to add dropout to.}

\item{trial}{the index of trial of simulation, all trials share the same truth but the 
noise is added independently for each trial}

\item{verbose}{whether to print the process or not}

\item{numCores}{the number of cores used for parallelization, default is 2.
If set as NULL, then all the detected cores are used.}

\item{nbatch}{number of batches, default is 1.}

\item{protocal}{a string, can be "nonUMI" or "UMI", default is "UMI"}
}
