\description{
Simulate a gene by cell matrix giving the mean expression for each gene in
each cell. Cells start with the mean expression for the group they belong to
(when simulating groups) or cells are assigned the mean expression from a
random position on the appropriate path (when simulating tree). The selected
means are adjusted for each cell's expected library size.
