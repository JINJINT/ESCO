\arguments{
\item{sim}{SingleCellExperiment to add gene means to.}

\item{verbose}{whether to print the process or not.}
}
\value{
SingleCellExperiment with simulated gene means.
}
\description{
Simulate base gene means from a gamma distribution. Also simulates outlier
expression factors. Genes with an outlier factor not equal to 1 are replaced
