# ESCO


Welcome to ``ESCO``! ``ESCO`` is an R package for the simulation of
single-cell RNA sequencing data with special consideration of gene co-expression, built ultilizing the infrastructure the [`splatter`](https://github.com/Oshlack/splatter) package. This package formerly known as `SplatterESCO`.
