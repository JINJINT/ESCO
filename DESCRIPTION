Description: This package borrowed the infrastructure from package splatter, which is a package for the simulation of single-cell RNA
    sequencing count data. This new pacakge allows users to simulate single cell data with any given correlations among genes, 
    while allowing discrete / tree-structured cell groups and smooth trajectories. It provides a simple interface 
    for creating complex simulations that are reproducible and well-documented. Most parameters can be
    estimated from real data and functions are provided for comparing and visualizing real and simulated datasets.
